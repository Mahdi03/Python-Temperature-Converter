#Temperature Converter 
This simple Python Project converts between "Fahrenheit", "Celsius", and "Kelvin"


Although the Instructions are written inside the program, use attributes such as:

`--F, --C, --K` and `--toF, --toC, --toK`
After starting the program, it will automatically print the help and the syntax.
It reads:

Hi! Welcome to Temperature Converter!!!

    Kelvin                         --K

3. Also use attributes to define which scale you want to convert to.

    Fahreinheit                    --toF
    Celsius                        --toC
    Kelvin                         --toK
Example: `84 --F --toK`

4. Press `Enter` and let the magic begin!!! Have Fun!!
